It minimizes bias and ensures that the results are valid, reproducible and generalizable. In this report we’ve analyzed the study design of five original research studies who tried to understand the association between menstrual cycle and musculoskeletal injury among female athletes. We describe strength and weaknesses of each study and comment on the selection of statistical tests to answer study aims. Lastly, recommendations are given regarding how future studies in this area should be designed to best answer similar questions.\\\nThe broader problem the authors are trying to resolve is similar in each study, but the specific questions they are trying to answer is angled differently. Chang et al. investigates the prevalence and relationship between hormonal contraceptive use, menstrual function and stress fractures in female collegiate athletes in the United States [@Cheng2021-ur]. Bingzheng et al. is also focusing on female collegiate athletes but limits it down to just soccer players. Their study aims to examine how the menstrual cycle and sex hormones affect knee kinematics, specifically during a 90-degree cutting maneuver [@Bingzheng2023-rp]. Female soccer players are also the population of the study done by Martin et al., specifically English national team players, as they aimed to enhance the understanding of how the menstrual cycle, including extended cycle length, may impact injury risk in said population [@Martin2021-av]. On the other hand, Ackerman et al. studied younger female athletes and investigated whether there is a difference in fracture occurrence between oligoamenorrheic athletes (AA), eumenorrheic athletes (EA), and nonathletes (NA). The study also tried to determine the relationship between bone density, structure, and strength estimates [@Ackerman2015-kk]. The last study, done by Thein-Nissenbaum et al., investigates the prevalence of and the relationship between menstrual irregularity and musculoskeletal injuries in female high school athletes [@Thein-Nissenbaum2012-wi].\n\n## Study designs\n\nOne factor all the studies have in common is that they use an observational study design. Observational studies have two primary purposes: descriptive where one examines the distributions of predictors and outcomes in a population, and analytic where one characterizes associations between these predictor and outcome variables [@Hulley2013-wg]. Most of the studies are cross-sectional studies as the investigators makes all the measurements on a single occasion or within a short period of time. Cross-sectional studies provide info about prevalence and can be used for examining associations [@Hulley2013-wg]. For instance, in the study done by Ackerman et al., data from different groups of participants were collected within the same day. They interviewed participants to document previous fractures, then measured areal bone mass index of the spine, hip and whole body as well as assessing bone structure. In contrast, the study done by Bingzheng et al. is also an observational study, but a cohort study as the measurements take place over a period of time. They measured sex hormones and analyzed knee kinematics of the participants during four different phases of the menstrual cycle. More specifically is this a prospective cohort study as the participants are followed over time to observe outcomes that occur after the study begins [@Hulley2013-wg]. This way of doing a study may be more beneficial than a cross-sectional study as it allows the calculation of incidence. On the other hand, the study done by Martin et al. where they tried to find the association between menstrual cycle and injury risk in female soccer players, can be classified as a case series study design. They recorded injuries and menstrual irregularities among English national soccer team players over a period of four years. Here the group of individuals all share a specific characteristic, they are tracked over a defined period and the outcome in the group is documented. Unlike cohort studies, a case series lacks a comparison group, meaning it does not compare outcomes between exposed and non-exposed individuals or those with and without a condition. This can be seen in the study done by Martin et al. as they gathered data on injury types and menstrual irregularities, but did not include a non-injured or non-menstrual-irregularity group for comparison.\n\n## Selection of statistical tests\n\nSelecting the appropriate statistical test is crucial for ensuring valid and reliable results. The choice depends on several factors, including the type of data you have, your research question, and the assumptions of the tests. None of the studies provided a detailed description of all the statistical tests used, and the studies varied in how many and what type of statistical tests they used to analyze the data. The study done by Thein-Nissenbaum et al. provided the most detailed description on how the data was analyzed. They used a one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test to compare mean values for continuous variables between different sport types. Chi-square tests were used to examine associations between categorical variables, such as menstrual irregularity and sport type. Lastly, they calculated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to compare injury severity between athletes with and without menstrual irregularities. Another study that reported OR and CI where the study done by Cheng et al. as they investigated the relationship between the different variables in their study. They also used two-sided t-tests to analyze continuous variables and Pearson’s chi-square tests to analyze categorical variables. Moreover, the study done by Ackerman et al. compared three groups (AA, EA and NA) regarding various variables such as fracture prevalence, BMD Z-score, bone structure and strength estimates. The study does not specify exactly which statistical tests were used but mentions using p-values to assess statistical significance. Based on this, and the study's goal of comparing groups, we can assume they likely used t-tests or ANOVA tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Another study that also compared different groups is the one done by Bingzheng et al. where they examine differences between menstrual phase, late follicular phase, ovulation phase and mid-luteal phase. The authors do not explicitly mention which statistical tests they used but we can assume that they likely used an ANOVA test to compare the mean values of knee kinematics parameters between the four groups. To examine the relationship between serum estrogen, progesterone concentrations and knee kinematics parameters, a correlation analysis, such as Pearson’s, were likely used. Lastly, the study done by Martin et al. used a more descriptive approach and did not perform hypothesis testing. Instead, it focused on calculating injury incidence per 1,000 person-days for each menstrual cycle phase and compared injury incidence ratios between the phases. All together, these variations in statistical methods underscore the importance of aligning test selection with research objectives and data characteristics to ensure meaningful results across studies.\n\n## Inference\n\nThe five studies analyzed in this report each contribute valuable insights into the complex relationship between the menstrual cycle and musculoskeletal injuries among female athletes. The findings highlight the multifaceted nature of this association, with varying conclusions depending on the specific study. For example, one study emphasized that hormonal contraceptive use is common among female athletes and may mask underlying menstrual irregularities, urging more education on this risk [@Cheng2021-ur]. Another study noted that sex hormones do not have a protective effect on knee kinematics in female soccer players, suggesting that other factors, such as neuromuscular control, should be explored [@Bingzheng2023-rp]. In terms of bone health, a study revealed that while weight-bearing exercise can improve bone mineral density (BMD), it may also increase the risk of stress fractures, especially in athletes with menstrual disorders [@Ackerman2015-kk]. The different phases of the menstrual cycle also appeared critical, with a study showing that muscle and tendon injuries might be more likely in the days leading up to ovulation [@Martin2021-av]. Lastly, high prevalence of both menstrual irregularities and musculoskeletal injuries was found among high school athletes, with those experiencing menstrual issues having a higher proportion of severe injuries, suggesting menstrual irregularity as a potential risk factor [@Thein-Nissenbaum2012-wi]. These studies collectively underscore the need for further research to clarify the mechanisms at play and develop more tailored prevention strategies.\n\n## Strength and weakness\n\nEach study design comes with its own unique strengths and weaknesses. Among the studies we reviewed, three utilized a cross-sectional design, focusing on capturing data at a single point in time to assess associations between variables. A cross-sectional study design can be ideal when the researchers don’t have the time or money to do a longer study as there is no waiting around for the outcome to occur. This makes them fast and inexpensive and avoids the problem of loss to follow-up [@Hulley2013-wg]. On the other hand, a cross-sectional study measure only prevalence, rather than incidence, it is therefore important to be cautious when drawing inference about the causes of the condition. A factor that is associated with prevalence of a condition may be a cause of the condition but could also be associated with the duration of the condition [@Hulley2013-wg]. In other words, it may be difficult to establish causal relationships from cross-sectional data. A cohort study, unlike a cross-sectional design, allows for the calculation of incidence. Here levels of the predictor are measured before the outcome occurs which establishes the time sequence of the variables and strengthens the process of inferring the causal basis of an association [@Hulley2013-wg]. It also prevents the predictor measurements from being influenced by the outcome or knowledge of its occurrence and it allows the investigator to measure variables more completely and accurately than is usually possible retrospectively [@Hulley2013-wg]. However, a cohort study is more time consuming and may therefore be expensive. In contrast, a case series study design is relatively easy to conduct and do not require the complexity or cost associated with larger studies, making it simple and inexpensive. The design allows for the collection of meaningful data from a small group of cases, and researchers can generate hypotheses that can later be tested in more controlled studies. However, it does not include a comparison group, making it difficult to establish causal relationships or to compare outcomes against a standard or control. There is also no control over external variables making it impossible to definitively conclude that a particular exposure caused the outcome. Additionally, all the study designs are observational studies meaning that causal inference is challenging, and interpretation is often muddied by the influences of confounding variables [@Hulley2013-wg]. It is therefore important to consider this disadvantage when choosing what statistical test to use when analyzing the data.\n\nIn general, most of the studies have a large sample size which increases the statistical power and gives a better representation of the population in general, meaning that there is a high generalization of the findings. They also had an extensive data collection gathering information on a wide range of variables, such as demographics, sports participation, and hormonal contraceptives, providing a detailed picture of the health status of this population. On the other hand, most of the studies relied on self-reported data about menstrual and injury history, which may lead to inaccurate recall. They also used a subjective approach to measure some of the variables resulting in less accurate and reliable data. Such lack of clinical data makes it hard to verify the results.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nTo better understand the association between menstrual cycle and musculoskeletal injury among female athletes, future studies should use a prospective study design where a group of individuals are observed over time. The researcher would observe the athlete before the injury occurs to better examine how specific exposures or factors, in this case the menstrual cycle, influence the outcome. Recall bias was one of the weaknesses of the studies we analyzed, a prospective study minimizes recall bias and allows for confounding factors making it highly reliable for establishing causal relationships. Another thing that can be done differently is how the menstrual cycle is measured. A more objective approach would be more reliable as hormonal measurements, or the use of menstrual tracking apps, can provide more precise data. Lastly, one should control for other relevant factors such as training volume, diet, stress levels and the use of birth control as they all can affect the menstrual cycle and frequency of injuries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, our analysis of the five studies highlights both the complexity of the relationship between the menstrual cycle and injuries, as well as the varying approaches taken to study it. While observational study designs were commonly used, each study presented unique strengths and limitations. Cross-sectional studies provided valuable insight into prevalence but struggled with establishing causal relationships, while prospective cohort studies allowed for a clearer understanding of incidence and causality but required more time and resources. Statistical analysis methods varied across studies, with some providing detailed descriptions while others left assumptions to be made about the tests used. Across the board, reliance on self-reported data introduced the risk of recall bias, and the lack of clinical data diminished the reliability of some findings. Future studies would therefore benefit from prospective designs, objective measures of the menstrual cycle, and better control for confounding factors to further clarify the impact of the menstrual cycle on injury risk.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Introduction\n\nA good study design is crucial for producing reliable and meaningful research results.
