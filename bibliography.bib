  abstract = "PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the effects of three
              different high-intensity training (HIT) models, balanced for
              total load but differing in training plan progression, on
              endurance adaptations. METHODS: Sixty-three cyclists (peak oxygen
              uptake (V˙O2peak) 61.3 $\pm$ 5.8 mL·kg·min) were randomized to
              three training groups and instructed to follow a 12-wk training
              program consisting of 24 interval sessions, a high volume of
              low-intensity training, and laboratory testing. The increasing
              HIT group (n = 23) performed interval training as 4 $\times$ 16
              min in weeks 1-4, 4 $\times$ 8 min in weeks 5-8, and 4 $\times$ 4
              min in weeks 9-12. The decreasing HIT group (n = 20) performed
              interval sessions in the opposite mesocycle order as the
              increasing HIT group, and the mixed HIT group (n = 20) performed
              the interval prescriptions in a mixed distribution in all
              mesocycles. Interval sessions were prescribed as maximal session
              efforts and executed at mean values 4.7, 9.2, and 12.7 mmol·L
              blood lactate in 4 $\times$ 16-, 4 $\times$ 8-, and 4 $\times$
              4-min sessions, respectively (P 0.05). Further, an individual
              response analysis indicated similar likelihood of large,
              moderate, or nonresponses, respectively, in response to each
              training group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that
              organizing different interval sessions in a specific periodized
              mesocycle order or in a mixed distribution during a 12-wk
              training period has little or no effect on training adaptation
              when the overall training load is the same.",

              (RT). College-aged resistance-trained males (training age = 5
              $\pm$ 3 years; mean $\pm$ SD) performed 6 weeks of RT wherein
              frequency was 3 d/week and each session involved 2 upper- and 2
              lower-body exercises (10 repetitions/set). Volume increased from
              10 sets/exercise (week 1) to 32 sets/exercise (week 6), which is
              the highest volume investigated in this timeframe. Participants
              were assigned to WP (25 g/d; n = 10), MALTO (30 g/d; n = 10), or
              GWP (25-150 g/d from weeks 1-6; n = 11), and supplementation
              occurred throughout training. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
              (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL), and biceps brachii ultrasounds for
              muscle thicknesses, and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy
              (BIS) were performed prior to training (PRE) and after weeks 3
              (MID) and 6 (POST). VL biopsies were also collected for
              immunohistochemical staining. The GWP group experienced the
              greatest PRE to POST reduction in DXA fat mass (FM) (-1.00 kg, p
              < 0.05), and a robust increase in DXA fat- and bone-free mass
              [termed lean body mass (LBM) throughout] (+2.93 kg, p < 0.05).
              However, the MALTO group also experienced a PRE to POST increase
              in DXA LBM (+2.35 kg, p < 0.05), and the GWP and MALTO groups
              experienced similar PRE to POST increases in type II muscle fiber
              cross-sectional area (~+300 $\mu$m2). When examining the effects
              of training on LBM increases ($\Delta$LBM) in all participants
              combined, PRE to MID (+1.34 kg, p < 0.001) and MID to POST (+0.85
              kg, p < 0.001) increases were observed. However, when adjusting
              $\Delta$LBM for extracellular water (ECW) changes, intending to
              remove the confounder of edema, a significant increase was
              observed from PRE to MID (+1.18 kg, p < 0.001) but not MID to
              POST (+0.25 kg; p = 0.131). Based upon DXA data, GWP
              supplementation may be a viable strategy to improve body
              composition during high-volume RT. However, large LBM increases
              observed in the MALTO group preclude us from suggesting that GWP
              supplementation is clearly superior in facilitating skeletal
              muscle hypertrophy. With regard to the implemented RT program,
              ECW-corrected $\Delta$LBM gains were largely dampened, but still
              positive, in resistance-trained participants when RT exceeded ~20

               and 10 highest (HIGH) hypertrophic responders were clustered
               based upon a composite hypertrophy score of PRE-to-W6 changes in

               hypertrophy score from PRE to W3, W3 to W6, and PRE to W6 in all
               30 participants. PRE-to-W6 HIGH and LOW responders exhibited a
               composite hypertrophy change of +10.7 $\pm$ 3.2 and -2.1 $\pm$
               1.6\%, respectively (p W3 > PRE), phospho (p)-4EBP1 (PRE >

               proteins (PRE > W6), mechano growth factor mRNA (W6 > W3\&PRE),
               45S rRNA (PRE > W6), and muscle citrate synthase activity (PRE >
               W3\&W6). No interactions existed for the aforementioned
               biomarkers and/or other assayed targets (muscle 20S proteasome
               activity, serum total testosterone, muscle androgen receptor
               protein levels, muscle glycogen, or serum creatine kinase).
               Regression analysis indicated PRE type II fiber percentage (R 2
               = 0.152, $\beta$ = 0.390, p = 0.033) and PRE type II fCSA (R 2 =
               0.207, $\beta$ = -0.455, p = 0.019) best predicted the PRE-to-W6
               change in the composite hypertrophy score. While our sample size
               is limited, these data suggest: (a) HIGH responders may exhibit

               II fCSA values and (b) possessing a greater type II fiber

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Menstrual irregularity (MI) is common in female
               athletes and is a component of the Female Athlete Triad (Triad).
               Many athletes with the Triad are started on hormonal
               contraceptives (HC) for MI, but this interferes with the ability
               to monitor menstrual cycle regularity and can mask other causes
               of MI. There are limited studies investigating the relationship
               between MI, HC use, and injury in female collegiate athletes.
               OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of and relationship between
               HC use, MI, and bone stress injuries in female collegiate
               athletes in the United States. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
               SETTING: Online survey. PARTICIPANTS: 1020 U.S. female
               collegiate athletes (age $\geq$ 18 years). METHODS OR
               INTERVENTIONS: Assessment of risk factors for menstrual
               irregularity and bone stress injuries was conducted via a
               one-time survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HC use, MI, history of
               stress fractures. RESULTS: Current HC use prevalence was 65\%
               (95\% confidence interval [CI], 61.9\%, 67.8\%). Of all
               athletes, 47\% reported past MI. Of the athletes who were not
               currently using HCs, 32\% had current MI. Compared with athletes
               without past MI, more athletes with past MI reported current HC
               use (73\% vs. 57\%) and indicated menstrual cycle consistency as
               the primary reason for use (24\% vs. 4\%) (P < .001).
               Additionally, 25\% of athletes reported a history of stress
               fractures, which was associated with lean/aesthetic sports
               participation (odds ratio [95\% CI]: 1.9 [1.4, 2.5]; P < .001)
               and less oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use (0.7 [0.5, 1.0]; P =
               .043). Compared with OCPs, injectable HCs were associated with
               greater odds of a history of stress fractures (4.5[1.6, 12.3]; P
               = .004). CONCLUSIONS: HC use was prevalent among this cohort of
               female collegiate athletes, and almost half of the athletes
               reported past MI. A goal of menstrual cycle regularity was cited
               by 24\% of athletes as a primary reason to use HCs, which shows
               that more athlete education is needed to avoid masking MI and
               the Triad with HCs. Further studies elucidating the relationship
               between HC use, MI, and sports-related injury are warranted.",

              During the first menstrual cycle, a three-step method was used to
              exclude subjects with anovulatory and luteal phase-deficient
              (LPD) (12 subjects). The subjects' menstrual cycle was divided
              into the menstrual phase, late-follicular phase, ovulatory phase,
              and mid-luteal phase (group 1, 2, 3, 4). In each phase of the

              knee kinematics parameters in three universities in turn. We
              found that subjects had a lower maximum knee valgus in group 4

               prevalence in oligoamenorrheic athletes (AA), eumenorrheic
               athletes (EA), and nonathletes (NA) and determine relationships
               with bone density, structure, and strength estimates. METHODS:
               One hundred seventy-five females (100 AA, 35 EA, and 40 NA)
               14-25 yr old were studied. Lifetime fracture history was
               obtained through participant interviews. Areal bone mineral
               density (BMD) was assessed by DXA at the spine, hip, and whole
               body (WB). Bone structure was assessed by HRpQCT at the radius
               and tibia, and strength by finite element analysis. RESULTS: AA,
               EA, and NA did not differ in age, sexual maturity, or height. AA
               had lower BMI, and older menarchal age than EA and NA (P $\leq$
               0.001). Bone mineral density Z-scores were lower in AA versus EA
               at the total hip, femoral neck, spine, and whole body (P $\leq$
               0.001). Lifetime fracture risk was higher in AA than EA and NA
               (47\%, 25.7\%, 12.5\%; P $\leq$ 0.001), largely driven by stress
               fractures in AA versus EA and NA (32\% vs 5.9\% vs 0\%). In AA,
               those who fractured had lower lumbar and WB BMD Z-scores,
               volumetric BMD (vBMD) of outer trabecular region in radius and
               tibia, and trabecular thickness of the radius (P $\leq$ 0.05).
               In AA, those who had two or more stress fractures had lower
               lumbar and WB BMD Z-scores, total cross-sectional area,
               trabecular vBMD, stiffness, and failure load at radius; and
               lower stiffness and failure load at tibia versus those with
               fewer than two stress fractures (P $\leq$ 0.05). CONCLUSION:
               Weight-bearing athletic activity increases BMD but may increase
               stress fracture risk in those with menstrual dysfunction. Bone
               microarchitecture and strength differences are more pronounced

  abstract = "Objectives: This study aimed to assess how menstrual cycle phase
              and extended menstrual cycle length influence the incidence of
              injuries in international footballers. Methods: Over a 4-year
              period, injuries from England international footballers at
              training camps or matches were recorded, alongside self-reported
              information on menstrual cycle characteristics at the point of
              injury. Injuries in eumenorrheic players were categorized into
              early follicular, late follicular, or luteal phase. Frequencies
              were also compared between injuries recorded during the typical
              cycle and those that occurred after the cycle would be expected
              to have finished. Injury incidence rates (per 1,000 person days)
              and injury incidence rate ratios were calculated for each phase
              for all injuries and injuries stratified by type. Results: One
              hundred fifty-six injuries from 113 players were eligible for
              analysis. Injury incidence rates per 1,000 person-days were 31.9
              in the follicular, 46.8 in the late follicular, and 35.4 in the
              luteal phase, resulting in injury incidence rate ratios of 1.47
              (Late follicular:Follicular), 1.11 (Luteal:Follicular), and 0.76
              (Luteal:Late follicular). Injury incident rate ratios showed that
              muscle and tendon injury rates were 88\% greater in the late
              follicular phase compared to the follicular phase, with muscle
              rupture/tear/strain/cramps and tendon injuries/ruptures occurring
              over twice as often during the late follicular phase compared to
              other phases 20\% of injuries were reported as occurring when
              athletes were ``overdue'' menses. Conclusion: Muscle and tendon
              injuries occurred almost twice as often in the late follicular
              phase compared to the early follicular or luteal phase. Injury
              risk may be elevated in typically eumenorrheic women in the days
              after their next menstruation was expected to start.",

  abstract  = "CONTEXT: The female athlete triad describes the interrelatedness
               of energy availability, menstrual function, and bone density.
               Although associations between triad components and
               musculoskeletal injury (INJ) have been reported in collegiate
               athletes, limited information exists about menstrual
               irregularity (MI) and INJ in the high school population.
               OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of and relationship
               between MI and INJ in high school athletes. DESIGN:
               Cross-sectional study. SETTING: High schools. PATIENTS OR OTHER
               PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 249 female athletes from 3
               high schools who competed in 33 interscholastic,
               school-sponsored sport teams, dance teams, and cheerleading or
               pom-pon squad during the 2006-2007 school year. Each athlete
               remained on the roster throughout the season. MAIN OUTCOME
               MEASURE(S): Participants completed a survey regarding injury
               type, number of days of sport participation missed, and
               menstrual history in the past year. RESULTS: The prevalences of
               M I and INJ were 19.7\% and 63.1 \%, respectively. Athletes who
               reported MI sustained a higher percentage of severe injuries
               (missing $\geq$ 22 days of practice or competition) than did
               athletes who reported normal menses. Although the trend was not
               significant, athletes with MI were almost 3 times more likely to
               sustain an injury resulting in 7 or more days of time lost from
               sport (odds ratio = 2.7, 95\% confidence interval = 0.8, 8.8)
               than those who sustained an injury resulting in 7 or fewer days
               of time lost. CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of MI and INJ in this
               high school population during the study period were high.
               Athletes who reported MI sustained a higher percentage of severe
               injuries than did athletes who reported normal menses. Education
               programs to increase knowledge and improve management of MI and
               its potential effects on injury in female high school athletes
               are warranted.",
